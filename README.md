# DesirePath
There might be times in your life when you are talking about a recent road trip that you went on or the last time you drove to the beach. So many times people may tell us about places that we would have never known about because the route to see it is a little out of the way and because of that our map application never suggests it.

I wanted to create a web application that allowed people to post their favorite locations for food, activities, scenery and gas. I also wanted to create a way for people to create a Path that has stops so that if other people are traveling to and from similar locations they can see other peoples suggestions. The quickest path is not always the best but if you have that perfect under five hour drive to the beach here is where you can post that route and share it with your friends.

The planning process was easy when I was able to use adobe XD to walk through my paths and actually interact with the routes of my website before I even created them. I have included links of the pictures below.

### Getting Started
Local:
To get Desire path working on your machine go ahead and clone the repo down, after running npm install and npm start it will be up and running on localhost:3000.

## Technologies Used
* Mongoose, Express.js, Handlebars, Node. 
* Bulma for CSS
* Postman MongoDB-Compass
* Adobe XD

## Preplanning
The first step of my process was to think about the user stories and create an ERD for my application. The most helpful thing to my preplanning process was Adobe XD. Before I started coding I was able to create my wireframes with Adobe XD and the great feature of this application was that I could actually create functions for the features of my site to actually traverse the website. Then you can zoom out to see where each path leads so that there is never a question about where you need to link the feature.

## Version 2
for my version two I would like to integrate a map API that then would actually display the locations that people added as stops.
